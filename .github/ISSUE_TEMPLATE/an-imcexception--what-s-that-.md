This is an issue caused by a *different mod* that is trying to communicate with my mod. In most cases, you will be told which mod is causing the problem. My mod is simply reporting the error to you.

=========================================

If you see something like "Search the crash report for ...", then it means the person who made the other mod *really* messed up and actually ended up hiding their mod's actual ID from mine. In the crash report, if you follow the instructions and search the report for the given text (hint: Ctrl+F / âŒ˜F is your best friend), you will see instructions that will make it super easy to find the mod that's causing the problem.
