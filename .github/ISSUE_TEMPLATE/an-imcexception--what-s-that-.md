This is an issue caused by a *different mod* that is trying to communicate with my mod. In most cases, you will be told which mod is causing the problem. My mod is simply reporting the error to you.

=========================================

You should instead find the repository for the mod causing the problem (you can often find this at the same place you downloaded the mod from) and send the mod creator your crash report. You may even come to a webpage exactly like this one. It is of extreme importance that you link the crash report and debug.log file (.minecraft/logs) **directly after you ran the time and it crashed.**
